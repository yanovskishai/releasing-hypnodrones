# Releasing the HypnoDrones

A fan-made trivia game celebrating the pop culture easter eggs hidden in [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)'s loading messages.

## What is this?

Someone at Google hid 62 pop culture references in the Gemini CLI's loading phrases. This game challenges you to identify their sources - from Star Wars to XKCD, from Portal to The IT Crowd.

## Play

Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step, no dependencies.

## How it works

- Type your guess for each loading phrase's source
- Press Enter to submit, Esc to skip
- Answers are fuzzy-matched (close enough counts)

## Source

The original phrases live in the Gemini CLI source code:
- [`packages/cli/src/ui/constants/wittyPhrases.ts`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/packages/cli/src/ui/constants/wittyPhrases.ts)
